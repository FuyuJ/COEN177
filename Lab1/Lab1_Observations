Observations for running 1.sh

I start the program with command sh 1.sh
The terminal lists the files found in the same file as my program.
It then lists the HOME, USER, PATH of the program.
The program prints "Please enter your name:"
I enter the input "Marianne"
The program greets me and allows me to proceed since the name matches the one in the program.
The program also tells me how many users are logged on.
The program then asks me to enter the height of a rectangle.
I input the integer 2.
The program then asks me to enter the width of a rectangle.
I input the integer 4.
The program then prints out the area of the rectangle which is 8.
It then asks me if I want to repeat the program by giving me a Yes/No option.
I input No.
The program exits and the terminal shows me which folder I'm currently accessing.
