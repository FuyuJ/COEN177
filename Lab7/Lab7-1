Title: Minix Scheduling
Description: Modify the Minix Scheduler to assign random priority to queues with priority > 2

Lab7
Steps for Changing Priority Queue in Minix 3

1. Open up a terminal on a school linux machine
2. Type the following command and press enter: setup vmware
3. Type the following command and press enter: vmware &
4. On the VM window (not terminal), open the minix 3 subfolder
5. Launch minix3.vmx by double clicking it and press the Power On button
6. When prompted for user name type: root
7. Type your password and press enter (you will not be able to see your password being written)
8. Type the following command in the VM and press enter: tcpd ftp /usr/bin/in.ftpd &
9. Type the following command in the VM and press enter: ifconfig
10. Make note of the given IP address and get out of the VM window by pressing Ctrl + Alt
11. In the terminal, type: ftp 172.16.127.132 //this is the ip address I got, yours may be different, change accordingly
12. Wait until prompted for username then enter your username: root
13. When prompted for password type the password you set up in step 8
14. At this point, go back to the VM and search for the Copyright statement via the following steps
15. Type the following and press enter: cd /usr/src/
16. Type the following and press enter: cd kernel
17. Type the following and press enter: grep -l pick *
18. This should return proc.c & proc.h
19. Go back to terminal window. (to escape VM press Ctrl + Alt)
20. Change your directory in your host machine to where you want proc.c to go to using lcd command (I had mine in /Documents/OS/Lab7)
20-2. Example of command usage: lcd Documents
				lcd OS
				lcd Lab7
21. Now change the directory of VM by typing the following: cd /usr/src/
22. Type the following and press enter: cd kernel
23. Type the following and press enter: get proc.c
24. Once proc.c has been copied over from your VM to your host machine open another terminal
25. In the new terminal access proc.c via an editor (first go to its location via cd)
26. I used vim proc.c, press 'I' to go into insert mode
27. Go to pick_proc function
28. Add the following code at beginning of for loop *see attached png in submission:
	if (q > 2) {
		int probability;
		probability = rand()%10;
		if (probability <= 2) {
			q = rand()% 13;
			q+= 3;
		}
	}
Whenever q is greater than 2, it will create a variable to hold a probability from 0 - 9, 30%
of the time, this probability will fall between 0 and 2. If it does, q will take on a random
value between 0 - 12, upon which 3 will be added to make it fall within 3 - 15, since we don't
want q to take on values between 0 to 2. 
29. Save the file by pressing Escape and typing :x
30. Close that terminal and return to the first terminal
31. Now type the following and press enter: put proc.c
32. Go to the VM window 
32-2. Type cd /usr/src/
33. Type the following and press enter, this will take awhile: make world
34. Once Minix is recompiled, type the following and press enter: reboot
35. If you if takes a longer time, between 5 - 10 min to reboot, you have successfully changed the priority queue.
